Note that the solution is bounded by 2 as the string can be cut into itself. 

After that, now you just have to check if the answer can be 0 or if it can be 1. If none of those, output 2. 

To check if it can be 0, the string must only contain ones. 
To check if it can be 1, the zeros must be all together.
